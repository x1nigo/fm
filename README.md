# sf

A terminal file-manager written in `bash`. Doesn't really have a name, it's just easy to type `sf` on the keyboard.

This is still a work in progress. As such it still lacks more features, but it works.

## Dependencies

- `bash` &ndash; Definitely need this.
- `coreutils` &ndash; You probably already have these installed.
- `xdg-utils` &ndash; For interacting with certain filetypes.

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/x1nigo/sf.git
cd sf
make install
```

You may need to use root permission to `make install` it just in case.

## Notes

Inspired by [fff](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff). I've always wanted to write my own terminal file-manager using shell scripting syntax.
